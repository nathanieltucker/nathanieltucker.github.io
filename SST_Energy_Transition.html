			<h2>Welcome to The Global Energy Transition: From Fossil Fuels to Renewable Energy!!!</h2>
			<h3>Quick Description:</h3>
			<p>With the goal of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, societies across the entire world are shifting their energy usage away from traditional fossil fuels and increasing their usage of renewable energy resources. While this is a promising shift for the future of our planet, there are many obstacles to overcome during this transition. In this class, you will learn about the traditional methods for producing energy as well as the increasingly popular sustainable methods including solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, tidal, and biomass. We will discuss how these renewable generation methods work, how they affect our societies, and what challenges stand in the way.</p>
