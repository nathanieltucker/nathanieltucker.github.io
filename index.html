			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				I will be working as a Battery Algorithm Engineer for Apple in San Diego starting in August, 2022.
			<br>
			<br>
				I completed my PhD in the <a href="https://www.ccdc.ucsb.edu/" style="color:blue">Center for Control, Dynamical Systems, and Computation</a> (CCDC) at <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/" style="color:blue">UCSB</a>.
				I researched in the Smart Infrastructure Systems Lab (SISL) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My lab is also a part of UCSB's <a href="https://iee.ucsb.edu/" style="color:blue">Institute for Energy Efficiency</a> (IEE).
				My research advisor was <a href="https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~alizadeh/" style="color:blue">Mahnoosh Alizadeh</a>.
			<br>
			<br>	
				I received my Bachelor's degree from Santa Clara University in June 2016 with Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering majors.
				I received my Master's degree (with thesis) from Santa Clara University in June 2017 studying Electrical Engineering with emphasis in Communication and Systems.
				I received my PhD from UCSB in June 2022, in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

The course was titled <i>The Global Energy Transition: From Fossil Fuels to Renewable Energy</i>. Course overview: With the goal of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, societies across the entire world are shifting their energy usage away from traditional fossil fuels and increasing their usage of renewable energy resources. While this is a promising shift for the future of our planet, there are many obstacles to overcome during this transition. In this class, students will learn about the traditional methods for producing energy as well as the increasingly popular sustainable methods including solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, tidal, and biomass. We will discuss how these renewable generation methods work, how they affect our societies, and what challenges stand in the way. </li>
